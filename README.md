The Third part of the task is submitted in Facebook-Project.

It is an automation testing project using Selenium C# built on Visual Studio. 
It consists of:
1- Program.cs which contains the basic functions needed to conduct the tests. 
2- Nunit.cs which contains Nunit setup
3- Login.cs which contains the login scenario
4- Register.cs which contains the register scenario 

Test users were not created as there is a problem with the link provided "https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/test-users", problem screenshot is added in TestUsers.png. 

Most of the main concepts of the automation project are included however, the implementation is not 100% ready due to time constraints from my side.
